        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">Here’s the magic number: <span style="color: #ef5825;">50 billion tons</span>.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">That’s how much of the Earth’s materials and life forms we can safely use each year, without destroying the web of life. &nbsp;That includes everything from wood to plastic, fish to livestock, minerals to metals: all the physical stuff that we consume.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">Right now, <span style="color: #ef5825;">we’re using about 80 billion tons each year</span> – way over the limit. &nbsp;So for growth to be green, we need to somehow get back down to 50 billion tons despite expanding GDP.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">When green growth theory was first mooted, there was no evidence on whether it would actually work – it was purely speculative. &nbsp;But over the past few years, three major studies have set out to examine this question.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;"><a href="https://www.boell.de/en/ecology/publications-green-economies-around-the-world-15194.html">A team of scientists</a> led by Monika Dittrich ran a model showing that under business-as-usual conditions, growth will drive global resource use to a staggering <span style="color: #ef5825;">180 billion tons per year by 2050</span>. &nbsp;At well over three times the safe limit, that means game over for human civilization as we know it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">Then the team ran the model with the optimistic assumption that every nation on Earth immediately adopts best practice in efficiency, with all the best available technology. &nbsp;The results were a bit better: we would end up<span style="color: #ef5825;"> hitting 93 billion tons per year by 2050</span>. But that’s not absolute decoupling, and it’s a far cry from anything approaching green growth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;"><a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/92268/13/Owen%20Journal%20of%20Cleaner%20Production%202015%20AAM.pdf">A second team of scientists</a> tested the same question again in 2016. &nbsp;&nbsp;They chose a different approach: they put a price on carbon rising to $250 per ton, and assumed that we double our efficiency with rapid tech innovation. &nbsp;The results were almost exactly the same. If we keep growing the global economy by 3% each year – which is what the World Bank and IMP say is required to stop this economic house of cards from collapsing &nbsp;– <span style="color: #ef5825;">they found that we’ll still hit about 95 billion tons by 2050</span>. No absolute decoupling. No green growth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">Finally, last year <a href="http://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/assessing-global-resource-use">the UN Environment Program itself</a> – one of the main cheerleaders of green growth theory – weighed in on the debate, hoping to settle the matter once and for all. &nbsp;&nbsp;They modelled a carbon price rising to a whopping $573 per ton, slapped on a material extraction tax, and assumed rapid tech innovation spurred by strong government policy. &nbsp;The results? <span style="color: #ef5825;">We hit 132 billion tons by 2050</span> – even worse than the two previous studies found. Worse because this time the scientists included the “<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230583108">rebound effect</a>” in their model. &nbsp;As gains in efficiency reduce the cost of commodities, demand for those commodities goes up, cancelling out some of the reductions in material use.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">And let’s not forget: all three of these models use radically optimistic assumptions. &nbsp;We’re a long way from even testing a global carbon tax, much less a tax of $573 per ton; and we’re not on track to double our efficiency. &nbsp;In fact, quite the opposite: right now our efficiency <a href="http://www.materialflows.net/materialflowsnet/trends/analyses-1980-2013/trends-in-global-material-extraction-gdp-and-material-intensity-1980-2013/">is getting worse</a>, not better.</span></p>
  
        <p><span style="color: #ef5825;">We cannot rely on the myth of ‘green growth’. It’s trustworthy as ‘healthy cigarettes’ or ‘clean coal’.</span></p>

        <h2><span style="color: #ebebeb;"><span style="color: #33ffff;">So it’s time to make room for new systems to emerge</span> – systems that don’t require endless exponential growth just to stay afloat.</span></h2>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">There are lots of ways to get there.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">We could start by ditching GDP as an indicator of success in favor of a more balanced measure like the <a href="http://rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm">Genuine Progress Indicator</a>, which accounts for negative “externalities” like pollution and material depletion. &nbsp;&nbsp;We could roll out a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/05/how-a-new-money-system-could-help-stop-climate-change">new money system</a> that doesn’t pump our system full of interest-bearing debt. And we could start thinking about putting <a href="https://peg.primeeconomics.org/policybriefs/a-sustainable-economy">caps on material use</a>, so that we never extract more than the Earth can regenerate.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #ebebeb;">The old generation of innovators believed that tech would allow us to subdue nature and bend it to our will. &nbsp;Our generation is waking up to a more hopeful truth: that our survival depends not on domination, but on harmony.</span></p>
